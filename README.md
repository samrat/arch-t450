# arch-t450

Config files and scripts I've used to set up Archlinux on my Thinkpad
T450. Right now, this is just a dump of most of the files that I've
had to change to get things mostly working.

- i3(with i3status)
- xinitrc
- dunst
- ...and more.

## TODO
- actually automate the setup using Ansible
