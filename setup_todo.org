* DONE i3status does not show correct battery level
- https://josiah.wordpress.com/2015/01/29/making-i3status-work-with-multiple-batteries/
* DONE volume/brightness controls not working
- Used xbindkeys
* DONE low-battery-notify
- Need to modify script to handle the two batteries
- Take an average?
* TODO Tune palm detection
- or maybe turn off trackpad completely?
* TODO save all config files
- i3(and i3status), dunst, xinitrc, shell scripts(~/bin), xbindkeys
- push to git, create a separate repo called arch_t450
- Don't push it to the dotfiles repo as a lot of things assume it's
  running on this specific machine. It won't be as general but I want
  these files to be there if I want to set this up again.
